# Alexander's Dotfiles

Yet another dotfile repo! 

If you're not familiar with them, dotfiles are generally customization files for things you use, e.g .gitconfig or .bashrc.
I've made this repository to more easily share my personal configurations across devices, as well as with anyone interested.

# Getting started
If you're on an Ubuntu system, start by running `./ubuntu_deps.sh`. You only need to run it once. 
If you're not on anything Debian based, good luck!

For the most part, you should just need to run `./install.sh` in this repo when changes have happened.
The command is idempotent: you can run it again without any issues.
